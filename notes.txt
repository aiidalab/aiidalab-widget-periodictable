# Things to do:
- add binder to test it
- validate if the selected_list contains unknown values
- optional list of ['string', '[list of elements]'], if present show it, disable missing chemical elements, filter like on MC
- allow, however, to have an option where the list is completely missing (and some option to disable some elements)
